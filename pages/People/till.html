                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Dr. Christy Till is a geologist and professor with expertise in how magma forms and shapes planets. Her diverse research interests include resolving the timing and causes of eruptions at active volcanoes in the US, using high pressure and temperature laboratory experiments to study subduction zone magma genesis, and investigating the likely compositions of magma and crusts on exoplanets. Her research has been recognized with a variety of awards including an NSF CAREER grant, the Early Career Award from the Mineralogy, Geochemistry, Volcanology & Petrology Division of the Geological Society of America, and the 2024 Daly Lecture from the Volcanology, Geochemistry & Petrology Section of the American Geophysical Union.  
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Dr. Till also prioritizes improving justice, equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility in academic science, including having served in related leadership positions such as the inaugural Associate Director of Inclusive Community for the School of Earth & Space Exploration at Arizona State University and co-chairing the Building Equity and Capacity Working Group for the international Subduction Zones in 4D (SZ4D) initiative. </p>
